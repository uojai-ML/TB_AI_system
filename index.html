                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health concern in South Sudan, where access to specialized medical diagnostics is limited, 
                especially in rural areas. Delayed diagnosis leads to severe health complications and increased transmission. 
                TB remains one of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases, particularly in low-resource settings. 
                Diagnosis typically requires expert radiologists and lab tests, which are often unavailable. This leads to delayed treatment and increased transmission risk. 
                Early, accessible, and accurate detection is critical.

                        <p>
                            Our application leverages advanced artificial intelligence to analyze chest X-ray images and detect signs of Tuberculosis. The process is simple:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A doctor obtains a chest X-ray image from the patient.</li>
                            <li>The image is uploaded into the AI model.</li>
                            <li>Within seconds, the system produces results indicating whether TB is present or not.</li>
                            <li>The doctor uses the result to make the next clinical decision.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This system provides a fast, reliable, and cost-effective solution for TB detection, especially in low-resource settings where access to expert radiologists may be limited.</p>

                            This is the basic structure of our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for automated tuberculosis (TB) detection from chest X-ray images. 
                            The pipeline begins with an input X-ray image, which is passed through multiple convolutional layers to extract key features. 
                            These features are then reduced using pooling layers, which help in lowering dimensionality while preserving important information. 
                            The resulting feature maps are flattened and fed into dense (fully connected) layers, allowing the model to learn complex patterns and relationships. 
                            Finally, the model outputs a classification—identifying whether the X-ray image corresponds to a TB-positive or a normal case. 
                            This architecture enables effective feature extraction and decision-making, making it well-suited for medical image analysis tasks like TB screening.

                            The CNN model achieved a high level accuracy in detecting TB from chest X-ray images. On the test dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 98%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The architecture's layered approach enables the model to extract subtle features from X-ray images, resulting in robust and reliable predictions. 
                            As shown in the results, the model demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing between TB-positive and normal cases, making it a valuable tool 
                            for rapid and accessible TB screening. The high accuracy indicates the model's effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in medical settings.

                            The confusion matrix illustrates the model's performance in classifying TB-positive and normal cases. 
                            The high number of correct predictions (true positives and true negatives) and low number of misclassifications demonstrate the reliability of the system. 
                            This robust performance, combined with a 98% accuracy rate, highlights the model's suitability for supporting TB screening in clinical environments.
